# 🎬 Movie Success Prediction (Mini ML Web App)

This is a simple Machine Learning–inspired project that predicts whether a movie will be a **Hit** or **Flop** based on key factors like:
- Hero Rating  
- Director Rating  
- Budget  
- Script Rating  
- Marketing Rating  

It uses a weighted formula to simulate prediction (no model training required), and Flask for the web interface.
